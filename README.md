# Data-Structures-and-Problem-Solving
This is a repo that I design and hold different data structures and problems that are used in different interview processes.
In this project I am searching for different data structures and if I like their concept I am trying to implement them along with some programs that are using it.


<h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
        Trie
      <p> This is a data structure </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</3>
